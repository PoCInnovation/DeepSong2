## I) - Introduction

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is the most used framework when it comes to Machine Learning.\
Whether for computer vision or language processing, PyTorch allows you to build the state-of-the-art in AI.

Developed by Meta AI, PyTorch is now part of the Linux foundation and is completely [open-source](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch).\
When we hear about deep learning, PyTorch is not far away as it is present in Tesla cars.
Currently, Google, AMD, Nvidia, AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, and many others use PyTorch.
As you can see, PyTorch has distinguished itself as the AI framework par excellence.

Good luck for your pool day
